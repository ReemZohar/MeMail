#  Gmail-like REST API â€“ Fullstack Project

##  System Overview

This project implements a modular fullstack Gmail-like mail system with:
-  A **C++ TCP Server** for blacklist validation (Bloom Filter logic).
-  A **Node.js + Express REST API** to manage users, mails, labels, spam filtering, and favorites.
-  A **React Frontend** simulating a Gmail-style user interface.

The system uses the MVC architecture and allows real-time validation between the Node.js backend and the C++ server over TCP.

---

##  Features
- JWT-based user authentication.
- Mail creation, deletion, draft saving, spam marking, and favorites.
- Blacklist support with automatic updates from the C++ server.
- Custom routing in React using React Router.
- Drafts and real-time spam filtering logic.
- Advanced filters on backend (`/api/mails?isSpam=true&isFavorite=false`, etc).

---

##  Running with Docker Compose

To simplify deployment and development, the system supports Docker Compose with three services:
- `cpp-server`: Compiles and runs the C++ BloomFilter server.
- `node-server`: RESTful API written in Node.js/Express.
- `react-app`: Frontend UI written in React.

###  Setup

```bash
# From the root project directory
docker compose up --build
